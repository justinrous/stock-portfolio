# Overview
This is a full-stack financial investment platform that allows users to track a personalized portfolio of stocks, view real-time price data, and access key financial statistics and news for individual companies. Designed with both functionality and user experience in mind, the application integrates data from the FinnHub.io API to provide up-to-date market insights.

## How it's Made
This is a full-stack web application built with a Node.js and Express backend. It uses a MySQL database accessed via the mysql2 library, with controller logic that securely hashes user passwords and manages sessions using express-session. The server renders dynamic views with Express Handlebars, while the client-side interface is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The application also integrates with an external financial API to fetch and display real-time data. To improve performance and reduce redundant API calls, it uses node-cache for in-memory caching. The backend is deployed on Google Cloud, with plans to deploy the frontend to App Engine for a fully cloud-hosted architecture.  

## Optimizations
- Integrated the FinnHub.io API to retrieve stock prices, financial statistics, and market news. Implemented in-memory caching with node-cache to store frequently requested API data, significantly improving response times and reducing the number of external requestsâ€”enhancing both scalability and performance.
